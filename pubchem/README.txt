Place the source PubChem Compound files into this directory.

Use the SDF gzipped files available at: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF/

The files are only needed for the ImportPubChem task. Once that is finished, they can be removed.

An alternative location may be specified using SCAFFVIS_PUBCHEM_DIR environment variable.
